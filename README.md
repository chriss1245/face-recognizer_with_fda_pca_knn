Little face recognizer which employs pca, fisher discriminant analysis, and knn developed at the data science degree in UC3m

This project is updated with educational purposes. It is far from being used practically.

- It can only recognize 25 faces which will be labeled with numbers from 1 to 25 (used as training set from the images folder.
Gotten here: https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~spacelib/faces/faces96.html ).

- If it can not recognize a face it will label it a 0.

- It supports only images of the dimensions of the images in the folder 'images'.
